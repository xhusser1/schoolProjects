Introduction


Hi, my name is Xavier and I am a graduate student at Northeastern University pursuing a Master of Science in Cybersecurity.
This repository has a collection of projects I have worked on while completing Northeastern's Align program
for students switching to a career in tech. The applications are written in everything from Python, Java, C, Shell, and Assembly,
and include projects from using data structures to create applications to using multiprocessing threads to paint images.
