Introduction


Hi, my name is Xavier and I am a graduate student at Northeastern University purusing a Master of Science in Cybersecurity.
This repository has a collection of projects I have worked on while completing Northeastern's Align program
for students switching to a career in tech. The applications are written in everything from Python, Java, C, Shell, and Assembly.
