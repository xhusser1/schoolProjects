Written #1 (errors)
1A. The elements within the lists are not separated by commas
    A simple fix is adding commas between elements   

1B. Strings are immutable so you can't change an existing string
    However we can create a variation of the first string by adding 
    'H' with the variable for 'Jello World' and first slice index after colon 
    ex) new_greeting = 'H' + greeting[1:]

1C. No error. Will return a Boolean statement
